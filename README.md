# liri-node-app

## About
This is a command line node app that can search for concerts, songs on spotify, and movie information. It accepts command line arguments as search terms, makes a request to the relevant API, and returns search results as a console log in the terminal window. 

I created the app as an exercise in node-based applications. I learned how to set up a .gitignore for node_modules, how to structure a packages.json file, how to hide sensitive API credentials in a .env file, and how to use the Axios node package to make API requests from Node.js. For users new to Node, the following documentation should make it easier to install the node package dependencies required before running the application.
